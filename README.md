Python Web App Geocoder using Google Maps API
This web app uses flask and Google's Geocoder API to allow vistors to upload csv files with an 'Address' column and have them Geocoded automatically.
Dependencies are listed under requirements.txt and Python runtime version is listed under runtime.txt.
Note: Be sure to add a Google Geocoder API key to the geocoderApp.py file to get the app functioning.
